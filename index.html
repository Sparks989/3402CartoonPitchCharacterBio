      <li style = "margin-top:5px"><img src="Images/Taya.jpg" style="width: 10%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="TayaAndAckee"><p style="margin-right:50px">Taya is an only child born into an affluent family. She has always been spoiled and sheltered by her parents who want to make sure she has a great life and never has to struggle for anything. She developed many quirks growing up, and she grew to become someone who marches according to the beat of their own drum and does not conform to what is around her. She has a carefree spirit and likes to explore and be out of the house. Her parents are the opposite and like for her to stay at home and be the daughter they want her to be, but she rebels against. She finds herself yearning for a chosen family of her own comprising people who are as adventurous as she is and who will accept her for who she is.</p>

      <li style = "margin-top:5px"><img src="Images/RED.png" style="width: 10%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="RED"><p style="margin-right:50px">Redwood, often referred to as “Red”, is an energetic teenager whose brawn often precedes him. Coming from a family of  massive beings, it comes to no surprise why he was so big and  strong. However, his stature does not compare to his brothers who often ridicule him for being the “runt”. Although it bothers him, he  rarely lets it interfere with his social life with others. Because of his popularity and success as an athlete in school, the harassment by  his brothers is suppressed.</p>

      <li style = "margin-top:5px"><img src="Images/Willow.jpg" style="width: 10%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="Willow"><p style="margin-right:50px">Weeping Willow, simply recognized as Willow, is a middle-aged woman who seeks happiness after her husband was rumored to be  murdered by synths. Because of the mystery that surrounds synths,  she was outcasted by others who did not believe the story of her  husband’s disappearance. As a result, she entered a depression  that involved her becoming an alcoholic. Prior to her husband’s  death, she was a kind educator that possessed a certain glow about  herself, but afterwards she became a vagabond.</p>

      <li style = "margin-top:5px"><img src="Images/Venus.jpg" style="width: 10%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="Venus"><p style="margin-right:50px">Mayor Venus, simply recognized as Mayor or Venus, is the primary official of the city, Nucleus. She is the woman who other women  envy and men adore, but her position within the community does  not warrant fraternization with the citizens. As a result, she spends  much of her time making executive decisions or in the comforts of  her home aside from her stylist. Because of her lack of association with  the citizens in the city, she is often regarded as cruel or harsh  although her intentions are pure. In some cases, she has become a  victim of the hereditary monarchy that was formed.

      <li style = "margin-top:5px"><img src="Images/Rick.jpg" style="width: 10%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="Rick"><p style="margin-right:50px">As one of the older members of his family, he has a huge responsibility in staying at home and helping to care for the family. As a carefree spirit, however, he would rather not do this. He does try to help in other ways if he can. Some things to note about him is that he enjoys getting on his younger relatives' nerves, and he also strikes up an unlikely romance with the mayor of the city.

      <li style = "margin-top:5px"><img src="Images/Akee.jpg" style="width: 10%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="Akee"><p style="margin-right:50px">She is a middle child in her small family. As the middle child, she always tends to find herself fighting for her parents’ attention. She grows up feeling invisible for the most, and so she is always searching for opportunities to be a part of something bigger that will draw attention to her. Ackee is always open to new experiences and people. Her ultimate dream is to make an immense contribution to the world- however this may take shape- and receive recognition for it.

      <li style = "margin-top:5px"><img src="Images/Acorn.jpg" style="width: 10%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="Akee"><p style="margin-right:50px">Acorn is a young boy whose parents vanished soon after his birth.  Luckily, he was saved by a gigantic squirrel that came to perceive the child as her own. Due to the child’s limited interactions with  other humanoid characters, he does not understand any particular  language well enough to communicate properly. Like most  children, Acorn often roams freely without supervision, finding  himself in trouble with other characters or sheltered by those who  find him innocent.

      <li style = "margin-top:5px"><img src="Images/Hybrid.png" style="width: 10%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="Akee"><p style="margin-right:50px">He doesn’t really know where he came from. As far as knows, he woke up to existence. He doesn’t have many friends around him, except for the one fish in his fish tank head who keeps him company from time to time. He tends to feel out of place since he does not know much about himself, so he wants to know his purpose and how himself and life as he knows it came to be.
