      <li style = "margin-top:5px"><img src="Images/Taya.jpg" style="width: 10%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="Taya"><p style="margin-right:50px">Taya is an only child born into an affluent family. She has always been spoiled and sheltered by her parents who want to make sure she has a great life and never has to struggle for anything. She grows up to become a carefree spirit who hates being tied down to society’s and her family’s expectations of her.  She marches to the beat of her own drum and does not conform to what is around her. Taya tends to have a hard time relating to most other people, so she yearns for a chosen family of her own comprising people who are as adventurous as she is and who will accept her for who she is. </p>

      <li style = "margin-top:5px"><img src="Images/RED.png" style="width: 10%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="RED"><p style="margin-right:50px">Redwood, often referred to as “Red”, is an energetic teenager whose brawn often precedes him. Coming from a family of  massive beings, it comes to no surprise why he was so big and  strong. However, his stature does not compare to his brothers who often ridicule him for being the “runt”. Although it bothers him, he  rarely lets it interfere with his social life with others. Because of his popularity and success as an athlete in school, the harassment by  his brothers is suppressed.</p>

      <li style = "margin-top:5px"><img src="Images/WillowOG.jpg" style="width: 10%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="Willow"><p style="margin-right:50px">Weeping Willow, simply recognized as Willow, is a middle-aged woman who seeks happiness after her husband was rumored to be  murdered by synths. Because of the mystery that surrounds synths,  she was outcasted by others who did not believe the story of her  husband’s disappearance. As a result, she entered a depression  that involved her becoming an alcoholic. Prior to her husband’s  death, she was a kind educator that possessed a certain glow about  herself, but afterwards she became a vagabond.</p>

      <li style = "margin-top:5px"><img src="Images/Venus.jpg" style="width: 10%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="Venus"><p style="margin-right:50px">Mayor Venus, simply recognized as Mayor or Venus, is the primary official of the city, Nucleus. She is the woman who other women  envy and men adore, but her position within the community does  not warrant fraternization with the citizens. As a result, she spends  much of her time making executive decisions or in the comforts of  her home aside from her stylist. Because of her lack of association with  the citizens in the city, she is often regarded as cruel or harsh  although her intentions are pure. In some cases, she has become a  victim of the hereditary monarchy that was formed.

      <li style = "margin-top:5px"><img src="Images/Rick.jpg" style="width: 10%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="Rick"><p style="margin-right:50px">As one of the older members of his family, Rick is expected to share in the responsibility of staying at home and helping to care for the family. However, he would rather not do this. He prefers to stay at work or have fun times outdoors. He does try to help in other ways if he can, especially in regard to protecting his younger relatives.

As the middle child, she tends to find herself fighting for her parents’ attention. She grows up feeling invisible for the most part, and so she is always searching for opportunities to be a part of something bigger. Ackee is always open to new experiences and people. Her ultimate dream is to make an immense contribution to the world- however this may take shape- and receive recognition for it.

      <li style = "margin-top:5px"><img src="Images/Acorn.jpg" style="width: 10%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="Acorn"><p style="margin-right:50px">Acorn is a young boy whose parents vanished soon after his birth.  Luckily, he was saved by a gigantic squirrel that came to perceive the child as her own. Due to the child’s limited interactions with  other humanoid characters, he does not understand any particular  language well enough to communicate properly. Like most  children, Acorn often roams freely without supervision, finding  himself in trouble with other characters or sheltered by those who  find him innocent.

      <li style = "margin-top:5px"><img src="Images/Hybrid.png" style="width: 10%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="Guy"><p style="margin-right:50px">Guy is a plant and robot hybrid who doesn’t really know where he comes from, or how he came about. As far as knows, he woke up, and he existed. He doesn’t have many friends around him, except for the one fish in his fish tank head who keeps him company from time to time. He tends to feel out of place since he does not know much about himself. One of his biggest goals in the story is to figure out his purpose, in addition to how himself and life as he knows it came to be.
      </p></li>
      <li style = "margin-top:5px"><img src="Images/Scientist.png" style="width: 10%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="Guy"><p style="margin-right:50px">Dr. Robustiano, simply referred to as “The Scientist” because it is easier to pronounce, is a mysterious human who appears in the
      city. Unbeknown to anyone else, the Scientist is the sole reason why the world is the way it is now. During his early
      experimentations, he aimed to restructure the Earth in a way that involved synthetic creatures overseeing operations. When things
      took a turn for the worst, he froze himself in an ice cap for centuries to protect against the very dangers he constructed, the
      synths. Upon his revival, he still looks to execute his plans, but he must be careful so as not to be exposed for his nefarious ways.
